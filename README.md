# Aya Mohamed — Portfolio (Static build)

This is a ready-to-upload `dist` (static) version of Aya Mohamed's portfolio.
You can deploy it instantly on **GitHub Pages**.

## What is included
- `index.html` — main website
- `style.css` — styling
- `main.js` — small interactivity (modals, smooth scroll)
- `images/` — SVG placeholders (profile, projects, favicon)
- `files/CV_AyaMohamed_AI_ML.pdf` — placeholder CV file (replace with real PDF)

## How to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g., `portfolio`).
2. Upload **all files from this folder** to the repository root.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set:
   - Source: `main` branch
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Save and wait a minute. Site will be available at:
   `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/`

## Customize
- Replace `files/CV_AyaMohamed_AI_ML.pdf` with your real CV PDF.
- Edit `index.html` to update project descriptions, links, or add new sections.
- Edit `style.css` to adjust colors/typography.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a **full React project** (with source code) instead of this static build.
- Produce an ASP.NET Core MVC version.
- Replace placeholder images with your real photo and project screenshots.

Tell me which of the above you prefer and I will prepare it next.
